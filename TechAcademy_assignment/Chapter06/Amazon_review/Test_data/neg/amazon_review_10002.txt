I’ve never been a Marvel Cinematic Universe fan; back in May 2012, the midnight premiere of The Avengers before I became a huge cinema buff, the only addition of the series I saw was Iron Man, which I felt no desire to watch again. I only bought a ticket to The Avengers because some friends invited me. Afterward, virtually the whole world went nuts and called it the greatest motion picture ever, I however just saw horrific, nauseous action void of artistic purpose. While softer attitudes towards Marvel eventually came my way, people praising ridiculous junk food over quality art still sickens me.

Even today, Marvel representing the early bane of my taste in movies still affects my outlook upon Avengers: Infinity War. Like Rocket Raccoon’s mockery upon anybody different, Marvel’s corporate heads blare their red logo in its abused emotional manipulation, whilst their followers turn a deep azure hue in moral discouragement.

This incorporation of many characters turns toilsome on a full bladder, since long stretches between subplots average between 20-40 minutes until returned to. The editors couldn’t keep them consistently active, but sure, they got enough time for infinite out-of-place jokes! Thor’s first scene with the Guardians alone contains nonstop laughs increasing the total runtime threefold. Gags continue throughout serious beats, particularly one where Drax snacking on chips interrupts a sad romantic exchange.

There are plenty… PLENTY of other flaws that ruin other evocative moments; whenever two combatants start punching and kicking, feeble battle choreographed by eye-sore camera movements looks set on anything besides vengeance. Rage seldom reaches full capacity, since no actors stayed on the same page: One aims to be optimistic (Chris Pratt), another aims to be deadpan (Robert Downey Jr.), and another cannot decide (Elizabeth Olsen), all cold in believability. Chadwick Boseman should take most of the blame as he continues his noncombative blank stares, alongside Chris Hemsworth as his obligatory smile disrupts any flow.

Here’s a clear perspective against the overhype of such a gimmicky unforeseen divergence from Marvel. Last Friday, Avengers: Infinity War skyrocketed up to #10 on IMDb’s Top 250, bumping up to #9 on Sunday (though it’s back at #10 now), surpassing genuinely good films: Saving Private Ryan, the Star Wars original trilogy, The Green Mile, Amadeus, and even Citizen Kane!

These classics knew how to present new ideas in clever ways, something the Russo Brothers failed at. Nothing they did here is as clever as you would want to think… the climax alone rips off The Lord of the Rings, an enduring trilogy about healthy retaliation, in its grand epic scale. Now, I understand Marvel does honor Stan Lee’s created universe enough to allow greater depth than previous superhero establishments, except those corporate heads beneath Disney’s control still insult the art of filmmaking by taking advantage of consumers for the sake of bank.

Instead of futile cash-bait, imagine if we celebrated genuinely intelligent narrative commentaries on true problems? Or better yet, stopped hating on DC fanboys because of foolish loyalty to nonexistent people with abilities we could never hope to obtain? Then I can guarantee you that the world would become a much kinder place without the need for a dictatorial jerk in a dumb America costume telling us what’s important in life.
