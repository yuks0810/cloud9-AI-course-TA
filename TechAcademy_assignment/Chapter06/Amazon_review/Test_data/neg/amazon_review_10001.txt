After all the hype it was more a letdown than anything else. There are allusions to things to come granted, Loki telling Thor they'd be together again, Dr Strange saying there was no other way, an idea stewing perhaps... but the hints about unexpected deaths and so on gave a different impression than what actually happened, besides Thor behaving like he's learned nothing and Star Lord acting like... well... not helping. What's up with Gamora?

So we wait until 2019 to see it get put back together, I don't know. Maybe the next Ant Man will be fun.
