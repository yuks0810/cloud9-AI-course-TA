The Bad: Disregard for plot points from the lead up movies, including the first Avengers (mentioned, but stripped of all layers). Characters having sudden new and unexplained personalities (bound to happen when they're juggling so damned many!). CGI is a wonderful tool, but when you see Spider-Man's head floating above his CGI body (no he did not get decapitated), it pulls you out of the narrative. The focus of the film was on too many characters who were not relevant to the central plot, maybe the excuse was to have an epic Final Battle scene in Wakanda (SPOILER: Some of those dead characters are needed for a Black Panther sequel, further proving my point).

The Ugly: One character death after another, with so many dying that they often skip to the aftermath or just state that Thanos killed them, it really pulls at the heartstrings... Except, as this review title implies, the movie has zero lasting effects. They wasted no time in throwing out all credibility (SPOILER: Thor caused the extinction of the Asgardians), so the rest is just a fun What If? movie focused on committing the Woman In Fridge clich√© as many characters as possible.
