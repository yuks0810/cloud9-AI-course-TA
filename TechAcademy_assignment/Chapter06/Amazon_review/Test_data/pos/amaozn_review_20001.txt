This movie is the best superhero film of all time. 

Over 40 characters, all with their own personalities, story arcs, fighting styles and big name actors playing them, are all used exceptionally well. Some have larger roles than others, but everyone plays an important role In the plot.

The writing and direction is impeccable, while there are a few story flaws and small plot holes, the film is paced very well and there are no sluggish points or scenes that drag on too long. You are basically watching three different scenarios throughout the movie, and they jump between them at just the right times.

The visuals are all fantastic, save for some very small hiccups that keen eyes will catch. The special effects are some of the most eye-boggling(yes, eye-boggling) you will see in any blockbuster. Thanos looks so real, and his facial expressions and movements are captured so well, that you almost forget you are watching a CGI model being animated.

Speaking of Thanos, he is one of the best villain in cinematic history up there with Heath Ledgers Joker and Michael B Jordans Killmonger. His motive is very clear, and he is written often times in the film so that you see the story happen from his perspective. He is ruthless, intelligent, powerful and driven, and the weight of his threat is felt within 4 minutes of the film starting. Absolutely phenomenal job Brolin, the writers and directors have done with him.

As they've proven beyond doubt, the Russos know how to film action scenes, and as far as I'm concerned they can be fight coordinators for any film they want and have my blessing. Their attention for detail, slick use of cameras and special effects as well as sound effects to make you feel immersed is unmatched in nearly every other superhero film. In fact, the only ones that really rival them are the other films they've directed.

But none of those things is the reason this film is the best. This film is by no means a perfect one. The fact is, though, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As a comic reader for the last 7 years and a superhero fan since infancy, this movie is everything I could have dreamed of in translating the experience of reading a comic book onto film. This movie is a love letter to fans, comic books, Marvels 10 year franchise, and superheros in general.

I am of the belief that superheroes are part of a long line of fictional characters that humanity has used to tell stories to inspire, revere and learn from. Tales of powered beings who had the strength and the will to stand against evil and do what is right, to protect the innocent and defend justice. Comic books capture this essence, by telling poignant and moving stories with these countless characters and the endless forces of evil they face.

This movie captures that feeling, that sense of wonder like no other. That scene when Thor returns to Earth in a blaze of lightning and might. When Captain America and his covert ops team take down 2 super powered alien beings to save one of their own. When Doctor Strange and Thanos engage in godlike battle, leading to Iron Man pushing his own limits to fight Thanos. And ultimately the fact that every stone Thanos receives is as a result of the heroes refusal to let a friend die and his willingness to do so. The film glorifies the selflessness of the heroes while pitting their moral code against insurmountable odds.

It has everything a moviegoer could want, bar a conclusive ending, and even that shows risk taking on Marvels part. Action, adventure, drama, romance, fantasy, it has it all. It is truly a perfectly balanced film, and a remarkable achievement. Hollywood continues its refusal to acknowledge comic book movies, but if we keep getting ones like this and Black Panther, it will be hard to continue longer.

In conclusion, I say this. You must see this film. This is The Empire Strikes Back of this generation. These things Im saying may seem hyperbolic but they are not. The day this film released will be remembered as a day unlike any other, the day the Avengers assembled and sacrificed everything to save the universe.
