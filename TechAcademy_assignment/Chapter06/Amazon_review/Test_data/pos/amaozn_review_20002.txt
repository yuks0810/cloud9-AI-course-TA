Marvel's Cinematic Universe has been building up to this movie for 10 whole years across over a dozen films. While some are clearly better than others, they all had done their part into building great characters for such an event as Infinity War.

The film features almost every hero in the MCU while missing some franchise mainstays like Hawkeye and one of the founding members of the Avengers (in comics only) Ant-man. But these two are not enough to take away from the excitement that is the ensemble cast of Infinity War.

I never felt like the film was mistreating any characters in terms of screentime. It felt well distributed, not completely equal, but that wasn't a problem. Some characters need more time than others and I think they handled that tremendously well.

The film is very action heavy. There's still emotional moments but it is most definitely a fictitious war film. Battles often happen but it didn't feel souless. If you watch the other movies in the MCU, like one should for this movie, you will not be confused by character's motives as they were established in other movies. Part of the fun in Infinity War is that you now get to see them interact with each other. Like the Guardians of the Galaxy finally meeting Avengers or Doctor Strange getting more involved. It's action and a lot of crossover fan service with tense scenes that brought tears to my eyes.

The thing that stands out to me the most is that most film franchises based off of books will try to split the last installment into two parts as a cash grab to lengthen their time at the theater. In 2014 when Marvel announced this film, it was Infinity War Part 1 with Part 2 the following year. They changed this of course probably not to look like the others, but it is very obvious that it's only Part 1. When I saw Deathly Hallows Part 1, I thought, "Well that was a little bland." I thought so even more with Mocking Jay Part 1. But after Infinity War "Part 1," I feel as though Marvel earned every penny. It didn't feel like a cheap attempt to extend the Avengers series, it felt right. I'm excited for Part 2 for different reasons than I was with Harry Potter and The Hunger Games. With those last installments, I felt excited for Part 2 because I knew it would be the "better movie." With Infinity War, I feel excited for Part 2 or Avengers 4 because this movie was so good I expect it to be either matched or topped next year. Marvel didn't just sell out on us, Infinity War is a "Part 1" worthy of its cliffhanger. I'll gladly wait a year to see this action packed film conclude.
