Yep, I said it, Many people are pissed upon watching the movie, and I understand the emotions there (No spoilers) but Jeez, Infinity War had me with a throbbing heart (even after the third time watching it) - THIS IS NO SPOILERS REVIEW

First of all, the Plot is brilliant, it broke down easily on the first time with few details I had to revisit the second and the third time, but it is brilliant, the movie did it boldly, and did it like no other super hero movie, One can say that giving the trends of Marvel movies plots, but this is like the highest you can go with stakes in a movie, it must be a gamble and yes it was for the directors I get why the ending was not everyone's favorite, but come on, there is a sequel, and the end is not what we would all expect, the ending was literally the last thing anyone thought, I feel like the directors did know what we were thinking and definitely surprised the hell out of us, but in all honesty, kudos to the Russos, for interconnecting, engineering and building this masterpiece of a culmination, making all movies, all stories and all characters flow to this plot.

Second, Thanos, he has got to be like the longest for them to develop, to build a character so complex in his own thinking yet so simple in his feelings, building a villain is really hard, but creating a villain with a balance was plausible. Third, the production of this movie deserves 100 out of 10, the Visual effects are stunning, the action scenes are astronomical, the pace and the combustible stakes are just INSANE, I was really thinking wait How far can you take this and they did, take it to the highest extremes, I usually am very critical of production issues in a movie but this was remarkable.
Last, the actors have all been, without a doubt at their finest, Chris Evans is at his best, Downey was at his best, Vision was amazing, Ebony Maw was one of the most phenomenal characters, Hemsworth was sooooo EPIC, Pratt was at his best, Zoe Saldana did deliver memorably, Iron Man VS Dr Strange was one of the best chemistry on screen ever, which is usually a hard thing to do in a movie like this, and THANOS, my god that guy roared, breathed, cried and smirked like a VILLAIN, Brolin deserves at least multiple nominations for this

Here is the summary for you, Avengers Infinity war is a SEQUEL, it stands by itself from a plot but is still dependent on what happened prior to it, A Masterpiece of acting, Chemistry, production and well engineered story, it is bold, it defies our expectations and it is pushing us towards Avengers 4 at a 200 Miles an hour, CAN'T WAIT!!!
